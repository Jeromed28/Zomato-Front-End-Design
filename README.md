# Zomato Front-End UI Design

I have developed a **Zomato Front-End UI** using **React JS** that replicates key elements of the Zomato website. This design captures the look and feel of a modern food delivery interface with a user-friendly layout and responsive design.

### Video Demonstration

You can view the demonstration of the UI below:

<video width="600" controls muted>
  <source src="./Output.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.

### Key Features:

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience across devices.
- **React JS Implementation**: Built using modern React JS practices for efficient and scalable UI development.
- **Dynamic Content**: Utilizes reusable components to dynamically render elements like menus, restaurant listings, and more.

### Image Sources:
